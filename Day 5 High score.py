#You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
#e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
#Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
#The highest score in the class is: x

student_scores = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

# Your code below this row 👇
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score
    # print(highest_score)

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")
